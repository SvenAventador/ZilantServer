# ZilantServer

This project is intended for a term paper, and then a thesis. This is the server part
To start the server, you need to create an environment variables file `.env` to connect to your PostgreSQL server. Next, you need to write the `npm install` command to install all dependencies in your project, and at the end write the `npm run dev` command so that the server starts working.
